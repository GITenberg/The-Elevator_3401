<h1><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>THE
ELEVATOR.<br />
Farce.</h1>
<h2>I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: Through the curtained
doorway of <i>Mrs. Edward Roberts&rsquo;s</i> pretty
drawing-room, in Hotel Bellingham, shows the snowy and gleaming
array of a table set for dinner, under the dim light of
gas-burners turned low.&nbsp; An air of expectancy pervades the
place, and the uneasiness of <i>Mr. Roberts</i>, in evening
dress, expresses something more as he turns from a glance into
the dining-room, and still holding the <i>porti&egrave;re</i>
with one hand, takes out his watch with the other.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Roberts</i> to <i>Mrs. Roberts</i> entering the
drawing-room from regions beyond: &ldquo;My dear, it&rsquo;s six
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; What can have become of your
aunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, with a little anxiety: &ldquo;That was
just what I was going to ask.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s never late; and
the children are quite heart-broken.&nbsp; They <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>had counted
upon seeing her, and talking Christmas a little before they were
put to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Very singular her not coming!&nbsp; Is
she going to begin standing upon ceremony with us, and not come
till the hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Nonsense, Edward!&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s been detained.&nbsp; Of course she&rsquo;ll be here
in a moment.&nbsp; How impatient you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;You must profit by me as an awful
example.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, going about the room, and bestowing
little touches here and there on its ornaments: &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;d had that new cook to battle with over this dinner,
you&rsquo;d have learned patience by this time without any awful
example.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>, dropping nervously into the nearest chair:
&ldquo;I hope she isn&rsquo;t behind time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, drifting upon the sofa, and disposing her
train effectively on the carpet around her: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
before time.&nbsp; The dinner is in the last moment of ripe
perfection now, when we must still give people fifteen
minutes&rsquo; grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; She studies the convolutions
of her train absent-mindedly.</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>, joining in its perusal: &ldquo;Is that the way
<a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>you&rsquo;ve arranged to be sitting when people come
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Of course not.&nbsp; I shall get
up to receive them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a pity.&nbsp; To
destroy such a lovely pose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s divine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;You might throw me a
kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;No; if it happened to strike on that
train anywhere, it might spoil one of the folds.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t risk it.&rdquo;&nbsp; A ring is heard at the
apartment door.&nbsp; They spring to their feet
simultaneously.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Aunt Mary
now!&rdquo;&nbsp; She calls into the vestibule, &ldquo;Aunt
Mary!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Dr. Lawton</i>, putting aside the vestibule
<i>porti&egrave;re</i>, with affected timidity: &ldquo;Very
sorry.&nbsp; Merely a father.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Dr. Lawton?&nbsp; I am
so glad to see you!&rdquo;&nbsp; She gives him her hand: &ldquo;I
thought it was my aunt.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t understand why she
hasn&rsquo;t come.&nbsp; Why! where&rsquo;s Miss
Lawton?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;That is precisely what I was going to
ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Why, she isn&rsquo;t
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;So it seems.&nbsp; I left her with the
carriage at the door when I started to walk here.&nbsp; She
called after me down the stairs that she would be ready in three
seconds, and begged me to hurry, so that we could come in
together, and not let people know I&rsquo;d saved half a dollar
by walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;s</i> been detained
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>, coming forward: &ldquo;Now you know what it is
to have a delinquent Aunt-Mary-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>, shaking hands with him: &ldquo;O Roberts!&nbsp;
Is that you?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s astonishing how little one makes of
the husband of a lady who gives a dinner.&nbsp; In my
time&mdash;a long time ago&mdash;he used to carve.&nbsp; But
nowadays, when everything is served <i>&agrave; la Russe</i>, he
might as well be abolished.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think, on the
whole, Roberts, you&rsquo;d better not have come?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Well, you see, I had no excuse.&nbsp; I
hated to say an engagement when I hadn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I understand.&nbsp; You
<i>wanted</i> to come.&nbsp; We all do, when Mrs. Roberts will
let us.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes and sits down by <i>Mrs.
Roberts</i>, who has taken a more provisional pose on the
sofa.&nbsp; <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>&ldquo;Mrs. Roberts, you&rsquo;re the only woman in
Boston who could hope to get people, with a fireside of their
own&mdash;or a register&mdash;out to a Christmas dinner.&nbsp;
You know I still wonder at your effrontery a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, laughing: &ldquo;I knew I should catch
you if I baited my hook with your old friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Yes, nothing would have kept me away
when I heard Bemis was coming.&nbsp; But he doesn&rsquo;t seem so
inflexible in regard to me.&nbsp; Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d no idea I was giving such a formal
dinner.&nbsp; But everybody, beginning with my own aunt, seems to
think it a ceremonious occasion.&nbsp; There are only to be
twelve.&nbsp; Do you know the Millers?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;No, thank goodness!&nbsp; One meets some
people so often that one fancies one&rsquo;s weariness of them
reflected in their sympathetic countenances.&nbsp; Who are these
acceptably novel Millers?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Do explain the Millers to the
doctor, Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>, standing on the hearth-rug, with his thumbs in
his waistcoat pockets: &ldquo;They board.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Genus.&nbsp; That accounts for their
willingness <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>to flutter round your evening lamp when they ought to
be singeing their wings at their own.&nbsp; Well,
species?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very nice young newly
married people.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s something or other of some kind
of manufactures.&nbsp; And Mrs. Miller is disposed to think that
all the other ladies are as fond of him as she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; That is not so,
Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;You defend your sex, as women always
do.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll admit that, as your friend, Mrs.
Miller may have this foible.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;I admit nothing of the kind.&nbsp;
And we&rsquo;ve invited another young couple who haven&rsquo;t
gone to housekeeping yet&mdash;the Curwens.&nbsp; And <i>he</i>
has the same foible as Mrs. Miller.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Mrs.
Roberts</i> takes out her handkerchief, and laughs into it.</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;That is, if Mrs. Miller has it, which we
both deny.&nbsp; Let us hope that Mrs. Miller and Mr. Curwen may
not get to making eyes at each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;And Mr. Bemis and his son complete the
list.&nbsp; Why, Agnes, there are only ten.&nbsp; You said there
were twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Well, never mind.&nbsp; I
meant ten.&nbsp; I forgot that the Somerses
declined.&rdquo;&nbsp; A ring is heard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!
<i>that&rsquo;s</i> Aunt Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp; She runs into the
vestibule, and is heard exclaiming without: &ldquo;Why, Mrs.
Miller, is it you?&nbsp; I thought it was my aunt.&nbsp; Where is
Mr. Miller?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>, entering the drawing-room arm in arm with
her hostess: &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be here directly.&nbsp; I had
to let him run back for my fan.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re very glad to
have you to begin with.&nbsp; Let me introduce Dr.
Lawton.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>, in a polite murmur: &ldquo;Dr.
Lawton.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a louder tone: &ldquo;O Mr.
Roberts!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;You see, Roberts?&nbsp; The same
aggrieved surprise at meeting you here that I felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;What in the world do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that when a
husband is present at his wife&rsquo;s dinner party he repeats
the mortifying superfluity of a bridegroom at a
wedding?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> I don&rsquo;t
know what you mean.&nbsp; I should never think of giving a dinner
without Mr. Miller.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;No?&rdquo;&nbsp; A ring is
heard.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Bemis.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Miller.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Aunt Mary at last!&rdquo;&nbsp; As
she bustles toward the door: &ldquo;Edward, there are
twelve&mdash;Aunt Mary and Willis.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; I totally forgot
Willis.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Willis?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Willis?&nbsp; Oh, Willis is my
wife&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; We always have him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Oh, yes, Campbell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, without: &ldquo;Mr. Bemis!&nbsp; So kind
of you to come on Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Bemis</i>, without: &ldquo;So kind of you to ask us
houseless strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, without: &ldquo;I ran out here, thinking
it was my aunt.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s played us a trick, and
hasn&rsquo;t come yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>, entering the drawing-room with Mrs. Roberts:
&ldquo;I hope she won&rsquo;t fail altogether.&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t met her for twenty years, and I counted so much
upon the pleasure&mdash;Hello, Lawton!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Hullo, old fellow!&rdquo;&nbsp; They fly
at each other, and shake hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Glad to see you
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span><i>Bemis</i>, reaching his left hand to <i>Mr.
Roberts</i>, while <i>Mr. Lawton</i> keeps his right:
&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Mr. Roberts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Oh, never mind <i>him</i>.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s merely the husband of the hostess.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>, to <i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;What <i>does</i>
he mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh, nothing.&nbsp; Merely a joke
he&rsquo;s experimenting with.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i> to <i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here directly.&nbsp; He
preferred to walk.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s your girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll come by and by.&nbsp;
She preferred to drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, introducing them: &ldquo;Mr. Bemis, have
you met Mrs. Miller?&rdquo;&nbsp; She drifts away again,
manifestly too uneasy to resume even a provisional pose on the
sofa, and walks detachedly about the room.</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;What a lovely apartment Mrs. Roberts
has.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;Exquisite!&nbsp; But then she has
such perfect taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>, to <i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, who drifts near them:
&ldquo;We were talking about your apartment, Mrs. Roberts.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;It <i>is</i> nice.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the ideal way of living.&nbsp; All on one floor.&nbsp;
No stairs.&nbsp; Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Yes, when once you get here!&nbsp; But
that little matter of five pair up&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you
<i>walked</i> up!&nbsp; Why in the world didn&rsquo;t you take
the elevator?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you had
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing that
makes life worth living in a flat.&nbsp; All these apartment
hotels have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Bless me!&nbsp; Well, you see, I&rsquo;ve
been away from Boston so long, and am back so short a time, that
I can&rsquo;t realize your luxuries and conveniences.&nbsp; In
Florence we <i>always</i> walk up.&nbsp; They have
<i>ascenseurs</i> in a few great hotels, and they brag of it in
immense signs on the sides of the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;What pastoral simplicity!&nbsp; We are
elevated here to a degree that you can&rsquo;t conceive of,
gentle shepherd.&nbsp; Has yours got an air-cushion, Mrs.
Roberts?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;An air-cushion?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;The only thing that makes your life
worth a moment&rsquo;s purchase in an elevator.&nbsp; You <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>get in with
a glass of water, a basket of eggs, and a file of the
&lsquo;Daily Advertiser.&rsquo;&nbsp; They cut the elevator loose
at the top, and you drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Both Ladies</i>: &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;In three seconds you arrive at the
ground-floor, reading your file of the &lsquo;Daily
Advertiser;&rsquo; not an egg broken nor a drop spilled.&nbsp; I
saw it done in a New York hotel.&nbsp; The air is compressed
under the elevator, and acts as a sort of ethereal
buffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;And why don&rsquo;t we always go
down in that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Because sometimes the walls of the
elevator shaft give out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;And what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Then the elevator stops more
abruptly.&nbsp; I had a friend who tried it when this
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;And what did he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Stepped out of the elevator; laughed;
cried; went home; got into bed: and did not get up for six
weeks.&nbsp; Nervous shock.&nbsp; He was fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d
want an air-cushion on <i>your</i> elevator, Mrs.
Roberts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;No, indeed!&nbsp;
Horrid!&rdquo;&nbsp; The <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>bell rings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Edward,
<i>you</i> go and see if that&rsquo;s Aunt Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Miller, I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Or my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;My voice is for Mrs. Roberts&rsquo;s
brother.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve given up all hopes of my
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>, without: &ldquo;Oh, Curwen!&nbsp; Glad to see
you!&nbsp; Thought you were my wife&rsquo;s aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>, at a suppressed sigh from <i>Mrs. Roberts</i>:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of his jokes, Mrs. Roberts.&nbsp; Of course
it&rsquo;s your aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, through her set teeth, smilingly:
&ldquo;Oh, if it <i>is</i>, I&rsquo;ll make him suffer for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Curwen</i>, without: &ldquo;No, I hated to wait, so I
walked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;It is Mr. Curwen, after all, Mrs.
Roberts.&nbsp; Now let me see how a lady transmutes a frown of
threatened vengeance into a smile of society welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Well, look!&rdquo;&nbsp; To <i>Mr.
Curwen</i>, who enters, followed by her husband: &ldquo;Ah, Mr.
Curwen!&nbsp; So glad to see you.&nbsp; You know all our friends
here&mdash;Mrs. Miller, Dr. Lawton, and Mr. Bemis?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>, smiling and bowing, and shaking hands <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>right and
left: &ldquo;Very glad&mdash;very happy&mdash;pleased to know
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, behind her fan to Dr. Lawton:
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I do it beautifully?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>, behind his hand: &ldquo;Wonderfully!&nbsp; And
so unconscious of the fact that he hasn&rsquo;t his wife with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, in great astonishment, to Mr. Curwen:
&ldquo;Where in the world is Mrs. Curwen?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be
here.&nbsp; I thought she was here.&nbsp; She started from home
with two right-hand gloves, and I had to go back for a left, and
I&mdash;I suppose&mdash;Good heavens!&rdquo; pulling the glove
out of his pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ought to have sent it to her in
the ladies&rsquo; dressing-room.&rdquo;&nbsp; He remains with the
glove held up before him, in spectacular stupefaction.</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Only imagine what Mrs. Curwen would be
saying of you if she were in the dressing-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Mr. Curwen felt so sure she was there
that he wouldn&rsquo;t wait to take the elevator, and walked
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another ring is heard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I go
and meet your aunt <i>now</i>, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;No, indeed!&nbsp; She may come in
<a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>now with
all the formality she chooses, and I will receive her excuses in
state.&rdquo;&nbsp; She waves her fan softly to and fro,
concealing a murmur of trepidation under an indignant air, till
the <i>porti&egrave;re</i> opens, and <i>Mr. Willis Campbell</i>
enters.&nbsp; Then <i>Mrs. Roberts</i> breaks in nervous
agitation &ldquo;Why, Willis!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Aunt
Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;And Mr. Miller?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;And Mrs. Curwen?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;And my daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;And my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Campbell</i>, looking tranquilly round on the faces of
his interrogators: &ldquo;Is it a conundrum?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, mingling a real distress with an effort
of mock-heroic solemnity: &ldquo;It is a tragedy!&nbsp; O Willis
dear! it&rsquo;s what you see&mdash;what you hear; a niece
without an aunt, a wife without a husband, a father without a
son, and another father without a daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;And a dinner getting cold, and a cook
getting hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;And you are expected to account for the
whole situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I understand!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what your little game is, Agnes, but I can wait and
see.&nbsp; <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Willis, do you think I
would try and play a trick on you, if I could?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;I think you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Come,
now, Agnes!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a failure.&nbsp; Own up, and bring
the rest of the company out of the next room.&nbsp; I suppose
almost anything is allowable at this festive season, but this is
pretty feeble.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Indeed, indeed, they are not
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Where are they, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>All</i>: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Oh, come, now! that&rsquo;s a little
too thin.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know where <i>any</i> of all
these blood-relations and connections by marriage are?&nbsp;
Well, search me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, in open distress: &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m
sure something must have happened to Aunt Mary!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand what
Ellery C. Miller means.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>, with a simulated sternness: &ldquo;I hope you
haven&rsquo;t let that son of yours run away with my daughter,
Bemis?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s come to a
pass where he wouldn&rsquo;t ask <i>my</i> leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>, re-assuring himself: &ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s all
right, of course.&nbsp; I know that&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Miss Lawton?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;No, no&mdash;Mrs. Curwen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Is it a true bill, Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Indeed it is, Willis.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve been expecting her for an hour&mdash;of course she
always comes early&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;s been
taken ill suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
that, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh, of course you never think
anything&rsquo;s wrong, Edward.&nbsp; My whole family might die,
and&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Mrs. Roberts</i> restrains herself, and turns
to <i>Mr. Campbell</i>, with hysterical cheerfulness: &ldquo;Who
came up in the elevator with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Me?&nbsp; <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t come
in the elevator.&nbsp; I had my usual luck.&nbsp; The elevator
was up somewhere, and after I&rsquo;d pressed the annunciator
button till my thumb ached, I watched my chance and walked
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Where was the janitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Where the janitor always
is&mdash;nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Eating his Christmas dinner,
probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, partially abandoning and then recovering
herself: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s perfectly spoiled!&nbsp; <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>Well,
friends, I think we&rsquo;d better go to
dinner&mdash;that&rsquo;s the only way to bring them.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go out and interview the cook.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Sotto
voce</i> to her husband: &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t go somewhere and
have a cry, I shall break down here before everybody.&nbsp; Did
you ever know anything so strange?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
perfectly&mdash;pokerish.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s nothing like serving
dinner to bring the belated guest.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as infallible
as going without an umbrella when it won&rsquo;t rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;No, no!&nbsp; Wait a minute,
Roberts.&nbsp; You might sit down without one guest, but you
can&rsquo;t sit down without five.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the old joke
about the part of Hamlet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just step round to
Aunt Mary&rsquo;s house&mdash;why, I&rsquo;ll be back in three
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, with perfervid gratitude: &ldquo;Oh, how
<i>good</i> you are, Willis!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know how
<i>much</i> you&rsquo;re doing!&nbsp; What presence of mind you
have!&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t we have thought of sending for
her?&nbsp; O Willis, I can never be grateful enough to you!&nbsp;
But you always think of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;I accept my punishment meekly, Willis,
since it&rsquo;s in your honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a simple and beautiful
solution, <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>Mrs. Roberts, as far as your aunt&rsquo;s concerned;
but I don&rsquo;t see how it helps the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i> to <i>Mr. Campbell</i>: &ldquo;If you meet
Mr. Miller &rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Or my wife&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Or my son&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Or my daughter&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell them they&rsquo;ve
just one chance in a hundred to save their lives, and that one is
open to them for just five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Tell my daughter that I&rsquo;ve been
here half an hour, and everybody knows I drove here with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Tell my son that the next time I&rsquo;ll
walk, and let him drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;Tell Mr. Miller I found I had my
fan after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;And Mrs. Curwen that I&rsquo;ve got her
glove all right.&rdquo;&nbsp; He holds it up.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, at a look of mystification and demand
from her brother: &ldquo;Never mind explanations, Willis.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll understand, and we&rsquo;ll explain when you get
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>, examining the glove which <i>Curwen</i> holds
up: &ldquo;Why, so it <i>is</i> right!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Were you sent back to get a <i>left</i>
glove?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Yes, yes; of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ll notice, this is a
right one.&nbsp; The one at home is left.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>, staring helplessly at it: &ldquo;Gracious
Powers! what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Pray that Mrs. Curwen may <i>never</i>
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Curwen</i>, dashing through the door: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be back by the time Mr. Campbell returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>, with tokens of breaking down visible to
<i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;I wonder what could have kept Mr.
Miller.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so very mysterious, I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, suddenly seizing her by the arm, and
hurrying her from the room: &ldquo;Now, Mrs. Miller, you&rsquo;ve
just got time to see my baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Roberts</i>, winking at his remaining guests: &ldquo;A
little cry will do them good.&nbsp; I saw as soon as Willis came
in instead of her aunt, that my wife couldn&rsquo;t get through
without it.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll come back as bright
as&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Bemis, should you mind a bereaved father
falling upon your neck?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Yes, Lawton, I think I
should.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Well, it <i>is</i> rather odd about all
those people.&nbsp; You can say of one or two that they&rsquo;ve
been delayed, but five people can&rsquo;t have been
delayed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too much.&nbsp; It amounts to a
coincidence.&nbsp; Hello!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;I thought I heard a cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Very likely you did.&nbsp; They profess
to deaden these floors so that you can&rsquo;t hear from one
apartment to another.&nbsp; But I know pretty well when my
neighbor overhead is trying to wheel his baby to sleep in a
perambulator at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning; and I guess
our young lady lets the people below understand when she&rsquo;s
wakeful.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s the only way to live, after
all.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t go back to the old
up-and-down-stairs, house-in-a-block system on any account.&nbsp;
Here we all live on the ground-floor practically.&nbsp; The
elevator equalizes everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Yes, when it happens to be where you
are.&nbsp; I believe I prefer the good old Florentine fashion of
walking upstairs, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Roberts, I <i>did</i> hear
something.&nbsp; Hark!&nbsp; It sounded like a cry for
help.&nbsp; There!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nervous,
doctor.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s easy
enough to go out and see.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes out to the door of
the apartment, and immediately returns.&nbsp; He beckons to
<i>Dr. Lawton</i> and <i>Mr. Bemis</i>, with a mysterious
whisper: &ldquo;Come here both of you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t alarm
the ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>II.</h2>
<p>In the interior of the elevator are seated <i>Mrs.
Roberts&rsquo;s Aunt Mary</i> (<i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>), <i>Mrs.
Curwen</i>, and <i>Miss Lawton</i>; <i>Mr. Miller</i> and <i>Mr.
Alfred Bemis</i> are standing with their hats in their
hands.&nbsp; They are in dinner costume, with their overcoats on
their arms, and the ladies&rsquo; draperies and ribbons show from
under their outer wraps, where they are caught up, and held with
that caution which characterizes ladies in sitting attitudes
which they have not been able to choose deliberately.&nbsp; As
they talk together, the elevator rises very slowly, and they
continue talking for some time before they observe that it has
stopped.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very fortunate that we
are all here together.&nbsp; I ought to have been here half an
hour ago, but I was kept at home by an accident to my finery, and
before I could be put in repair I heard it striking the quarter
past.&nbsp; I <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>don&rsquo;t know what my niece will say to me.&nbsp; I
hope you good people will all stand by me if she should be
violent.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;In what a poor man may with his
wife&rsquo;s fan, you shall command me, Mrs.
Crashaw.&rdquo;&nbsp; He takes the fan out, and unfurls it.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Did she send you back for
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have had the pleasure
of arriving with you if she hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>, laughing, to <i>Mrs. Curwen</i>:
&ldquo;What did you send <i>yours</i> back for, my
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>, thrusting out one hand gloved, and the
other ungloved: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want two rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Not even women&rsquo;s
rights?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Oh, so young and so depraved!&nbsp;
Are all the young men in Florence so bad?&rdquo;&nbsp; Surveying
her extended arms, which she turns over: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know that I need have sent him for the other glove.&nbsp; I could
have explained to Mrs. Roberts.&nbsp; Perhaps she would have
forgiven my coming in one glove.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, looking down at the pretty arms: &ldquo;If she
had seen you without.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Oh, you were
looking!&rdquo;&nbsp; She rapidly involves her arms in her
wrap.&nbsp; Then she suddenly unwraps them, and regards them
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;What if he should bring a ten-button
instead of an eight!&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s quite capable of doing
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Are there such things as ten-button
gloves?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;You would think there were
ten-thousand button gloves if you had them to button.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;It would depend upon whom I had to
button them for.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;For Mrs. Miller, for
example.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;We women are too bad, always
sending people back for something.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s well the men
don&rsquo;t know <i>how</i> bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;&rsquo;Sh!&nbsp; Mr. Miller is
listening.&nbsp; And he thought we were perfect.&nbsp; He asks
nothing better than to be sent back for his wife&rsquo;s
fan.&nbsp; And he doesn&rsquo;t say anything even under his
breath when she finds she&rsquo;s forgotten it, and begins,
&lsquo;Oh, dearest, my fan&rsquo;&mdash;Mr. Curwen does.&nbsp;
But he goes all the same.&nbsp; I hope you have your father in
good training, Miss Lawton.&nbsp; You must <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>commence
with your father, if you expect your husband to be
&lsquo;good.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Then mine will never behave, for
papa is perfectly incorrigible.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear such a bad
report of him.&nbsp; Shouldn&rsquo;t <i>you</i> think he would be
&lsquo;good,&rsquo; Mr. Bemis?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;I should think he would
try.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;A diplomat, as well as a punster
already!&nbsp; I must warn Miss Lawton.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>, interposing to spare the young people:
&ldquo;What an amusing thing elevator etiquette is!&nbsp; Why
should the gentlemen take their hats off?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t
you take your hats off in a horse-car?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;The theory is that the elevator is a
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;We were at a hotel in London
where they called it the Ascending Room.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Oh, how amusing!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, looking about: &ldquo;This is a regular
drawing-room for size and luxury.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re usually
such cribs in these hotels.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very nice,
though I say it that shouldn&rsquo;t of my niece&rsquo;s
elevator.&nbsp; The worst about it is, it&rsquo;s so
slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Some of these elevators in
America go up like express trains.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>, drawing her shawl about her shoulders, as
if to be ready to step out: &ldquo;Well, I never get into one
without taking my life in my hand, and my heart in my
mouth.&nbsp; I suppose every one really expects an elevator to
drop with them, some day, just as everybody really expects to see
a ghost some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Oh, my dear! what an extremely
disagreeable subject of conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Mrs.
Crashaw.&nbsp; When I reflect that there are two thousand
elevators in Boston, and that the inspectors have just pronounced
a hundred and seventy of them unsafe, I&rsquo;m so desperate when
I get into one that I could&mdash;flirt!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, guarding himself with the fan: &ldquo;Not with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>, to young <i>Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;How it
<i>does</i> creep!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>, looking down fondly at her:
&ldquo;Oh, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Why, it doesn&rsquo;t go at
all!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s stopped.&nbsp; Let us get out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They all rise.</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>, pulling at the rope:
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not there, yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>, with mingled trepidation and severity:
&ldquo;Not there?&nbsp; What are you stopping, then,
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; It
seems to be caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Caught?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Caught?&nbsp; Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;re</i> caught, I should
say.&rdquo;&nbsp; She sinks back on the seat.</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;Seemed to be going kind of
funny all day!&rdquo;&nbsp; He keeps tugging at the rope.</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, arresting the boy&rsquo;s efforts: &ldquo;Well,
hold on&mdash;stop!&nbsp; What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;Trying to make it
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t be
so&mdash;violent about it.&nbsp; You might break
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;Break a wire rope like
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Well, well, be quiet now.&nbsp; Ladies,
I think you&rsquo;d better sit down&mdash;and as gently as
possible.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t move about much.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Move!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
stone.&nbsp; And I wish for my part I were a feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, to the boy:
&ldquo;Er&mdash;a&mdash;er&mdash;where do you suppose we
are?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the shaft
between the fourth and fifth floors.&rdquo;&nbsp; He attempts a
fresh demonstration on the rope, but is prevented.</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Hold on!&nbsp;
Er&mdash;er&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>, as if the boy had to be communicated with
through an interpreter: &ldquo;Ask him if it&rsquo;s ever
happened before.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Were you ever caught
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;He says no.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Ask him if the elevator has a
safety device.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Has it got a safety device?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;He says he don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>, in a shriek of hysterical laughter:
&ldquo;Why, he understands English!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>, sternly ignoring the insinuation: <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>&ldquo;Ask
him if there&rsquo;s any means of calling the janitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Could you call the janitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>, ironically: &ldquo;Well, there
ain&rsquo;t any telephone attachment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, solemnly: &ldquo;No, he says there
isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>, sinking back on the seat with
resignation: &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know what my niece will
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Poor papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>, gathering one of her wandering hands
into his: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
there&rsquo;s no danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>, indignantly: &ldquo;Why, she
can&rsquo;t drop.&nbsp; The cogs in the runs won&rsquo;t let
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>All</i>: &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, with a sigh of relief: &ldquo;I knew there must
be something of the kind.&nbsp; Well, I wish my wife had her
fan.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;And if I had my left glove I should
be perfectly happy.&nbsp; Not that I know what the cogs in the
runs are!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re merely caught
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite enough for
the purpose.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t you put on a life-preserver,
Mr. Miller, and go ashore and get help from the
natives?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>, putting her handkerchief to her eyes:
&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>, putting her arm around her:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, my child.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
no danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>, caressing the hand which he holds:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;No, no; I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Keep fast hold of my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Oh, yes, I will!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
ashamed to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>, fervently: &ldquo;Oh, you
needn&rsquo;t be!&nbsp; It is perfectly natural you
should.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too badly scared for
tears.&nbsp; Mr. Miller, you seem to be in charge of this
expedition&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t you do something?&nbsp; Throw out
ballast, or let the boy down in a parachute?&nbsp; Or I&rsquo;ve
read of a shipwreck where the survivors, in an open boat, joined
in a cry, and attracted the notice of a vessel that was going to
pass them.&nbsp; We might join in a cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all very well
joking, Mrs. Curwen&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;You call it joking!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not so amusing, being
cooped up here indefinitely.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how
we&rsquo;re to get out.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t join in a cry, and
rouse the whole house.&nbsp; It would be ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;And our present attitude is so
eminently dignified!&nbsp; Well, I suppose we shall have to cast
lots pretty soon to see which of us shall be sacrificed to
nourish the survivors.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s long past
dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>, breaking down: &ldquo;Oh,
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> say such terrible things.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>, indignantly comforting her:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t cry.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
danger.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s perfectly safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i> to <i>The Elevator Boy</i>:
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you climb up the cable, and get on to the
landing, and&mdash;ah!&mdash;get somebody?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;I could, maybe, if there was a
hole in the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, glancing up: &ldquo;Ah! true.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>, with an old lady&rsquo;s serious
kindness: &ldquo;My boy, can&rsquo;t you think of anything to do
for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span><i>The Elevator Boy</i> yielding to the touch of
humanity, and bursting into tears: &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, I
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And everybody&rsquo;s blamin&rsquo; me, as if
I done it.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s my poor mother goin&rsquo; to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>, soothingly: &ldquo;But you said the runs
in the cogs&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;How can I tell!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what they say.&nbsp; They hain&rsquo;t never been
tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>, springing to her feet: &ldquo;There!&nbsp;
I knew I should.&nbsp; Oh&rdquo;&mdash;She sinks fainting to the
floor.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>, abandoning Miss Lawton to the
ministrations of young Mr. Bemis, while she kneels beside Mrs.
Curwen and chafes her hand: &ldquo;Oh, poor thing!&nbsp; I knew
she was overwrought by the way she was keeping up.&nbsp; Give her
air, Mr. Miller.&nbsp; Open a&mdash;Oh, there isn&rsquo;t any
window!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, dropping on his knees, and fanning Mrs. Curwen:
&ldquo;There! there!&nbsp; Wake up, Mrs. Curwen.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t mean to scold you for joking.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t,
indeed.&nbsp; I&mdash;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what the deuce
I&rsquo;m up to.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gathers Mrs. Curwen&rsquo;s
inanimate form in his arms, and fans her face where it lies on
his shoulder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what my wife would say
if&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;She would say that you were
doing your duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, a little consoled: &ldquo;Oh, do you think
so?&nbsp; Well, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Do you feel faint at all, Miss
Lawton?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>: &ldquo;No, I think not.&nbsp; No, not if
you say it&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure it
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>, renewing her hold upon his hand:
&ldquo;Well, then!&nbsp; Perhaps I hurt you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;No, no!&nbsp; You
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>: &ldquo;How kind you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>, opening her eyes:
&ldquo;Where&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, rapidly transferring her to Mrs. Crashaw:
&ldquo;Still in the elevator, Mrs. Curwen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rising to
his feet: &ldquo;Something must be done.&nbsp; Perhaps we
<i>had</i> better unite in a cry.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s ridiculous, of
course.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s the only thing we can do.&nbsp; Now,
then!&nbsp; Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Agne-e-e-s!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>, faintly: &ldquo;Walter!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;Say!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Oh, that won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; All join
in &lsquo;Hello!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><i>All</i>: &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;<i>Once</i> more!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>All</i>: &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Now wait a while.&rdquo;&nbsp; After an
interval: &ldquo;No, nobody coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; He takes out his
watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must repeat this cry at intervals of a
half-minute.&nbsp; Now, then!&rdquo;&nbsp; They all join in the
cry, repeating it as <i>Mr. Miller</i> makes the signal with his
lifted hand.</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s no use!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;They <i>won&rsquo;t</i>

<p><i>Roberts</i> appears at the outer door of his apartment on
the fifth floor.&nbsp; It opens upon a spacious landing, to which
a wide staircase ascends at one side.&nbsp; At the other is seen
the grated door to the shaft of the elevator.&nbsp; He peers
about on all sides, and listens for a moment before he
speaks.</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Hello yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, invisibly from the shaft: &ldquo;Is that you,
Roberts?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Yes; where in the world are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;In the elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re <i>all</i> here,

<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The elevator has

<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Since the world began!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use asking how it
happened?&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t know, and we don&rsquo;t
care.&nbsp; What we want to do is to get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Yes, yes!&nbsp; Be
careful!&rdquo;&nbsp; He rises from his frog-like posture at the
grating, and walks the landing in agitation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
hold on a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Oh, <i>we</i> sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t

<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what can be

<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Well, see quick, please.&nbsp; We have

Don&rsquo;t alarm Mrs. Miller, if you can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;You <i>may</i> alarm Mr.

<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;What!&nbsp; Are <i>you</i>

Well, wait a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Oh, you can trust us to

<p><i>Roberts</i>, returning with <i>Dr. Lawton</i>, and <i>Mr.

shaft: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just under here in the well of the
elevator, midway between the two stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t say
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Bless my heart!&nbsp; What are they doing

<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not doing

<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting for you to do

<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a great thing in

there?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, indignantly: &ldquo;How do you suppose?&nbsp;
We came up in the elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

the rest of the way?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;What seems to be the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Have you tried to start it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll leave that to your

<p><i>Miller</i>, interrupting: &ldquo;Roberts, who&rsquo;s that
talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>, coming forward politely: &ldquo;Oh, excuse
me!&nbsp; I forgot that you didn&rsquo;t know each other.&nbsp;
Dr. Lawton, Mr. Miller.&rdquo;&nbsp; Introducing them.</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Glad to know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Very happy to make your acquaintance,
and hope some day to see you.&nbsp; And now, if you have
completed your diagnosis&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;None of us have ever had it before,

Just wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;You seem to think we&rsquo;re going to
run away.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t we keep quiet?&nbsp; Do you
suppose we&rsquo;re going to be very boisterous, shut up here
like rats in a trap?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Or birds in a cage, if you want a
more pleasing image.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;How are you going to get us out,

<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know yet.&nbsp; But keep

<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Keep quiet!&nbsp; Great heavens!
we&rsquo;re afraid to stir a finger.&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t say
&lsquo;keep quiet&rsquo; any more, for we can&rsquo;t stand
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in open rebellion.&nbsp; What
are you going to do, Roberts?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>, rising and scratching his head: &ldquo;Well, I
don&rsquo;t know yet.&nbsp; We might break a hole in the
roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t think that would
do.&nbsp; Besides you&rsquo;d have to get a carpenter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; And it would
make a racket, and alarm the house&rdquo;&mdash;staring
desperately at the grated doorway of the shaft.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I
<a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>could
only find an elevator man&mdash;an elevator builder!&nbsp; But of
course they all live in the suburbs, and they&rsquo;re keeping
Christmas, and it would take too long, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better send for the
police?&nbsp; It seems to me it&rsquo;s a case for the
authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Ah, there speaks the Europeanized
mind!&nbsp; They always leave the initiative to the
authorities.&nbsp; Go out and sound the fire-alarm,
Roberts.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a case for the Fire
Department.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all very well to joke,
Dr. Lawton.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you prescribe
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Surgical treatment seems to be
indicated, and I&rsquo;m merely a general
practitioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;If Willis were only here, he&rsquo;d
find some way out of it.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll have to go for
help somewhere&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i> and <i>Mrs. Miller</i>, bursting upon the
scene: &ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;Ah, you needn&rsquo;t go for help, my
dear fellow.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s come!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;What are you all doing here,
Edward?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;Oh, have you had any bad news of
Mr. Miller?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Or Aunt Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, calling up: &ldquo;Well, are you going to keep
us here all night?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you do
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; Oh,
it&rsquo;s Mr. Miller!&nbsp; Oh, where are you,
Ellery?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;In the elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;Oh! and where is the
elevator?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you get out?&nbsp;
Oh&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s caught, and we
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;Caught?&nbsp; Oh, then you will be
killed&mdash;killed&mdash;killed!&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s all my
fault, sending you back after my fan, and I had it all the time
in my own pocket; and it comes from my habit of giving it to you
to carry in your overcoat pocket, because it&rsquo;s deep, and
the fan can&rsquo;t break.&nbsp; And of course I never thought of
my own pocket, and I never <i>should</i> have thought of it at
all if Mr. Curwen hadn&rsquo;t been going back to get Mrs.
Curwen&rsquo;s glove, for he&rsquo;d brought another right after
she&rsquo;d sent him for a left, and we were all having such a
laugh about it, and I just happened to put my hand on my pocket,
and there I felt the fan.&nbsp; And oh, <i>what</i> shall I
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Miller utters these explanations and
self-reproaches <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>in a lamentable voice, while crouching close to the
grated door to the elevator shaft, and clinging to its
meshes.</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Well, well, it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got you another fan, here.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be
frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, wildly: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Aunt Mary,
Edward?&nbsp; Has Willis got back?&rdquo;&nbsp; At a guilty look
from her husband: &ldquo;Edward! <i>don&rsquo;t</i> tell me that

Edward!&nbsp; For your own sake don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
tell me that your own child&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s aunt is down
there, suspended between heaven and earth
like&mdash;like&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;The coffin of the Prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; <i>Don&rsquo;t</i> tell
me, Edward!&nbsp; Spare your child&rsquo;s mother, if you
won&rsquo;t spare your wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Agnes! don&rsquo;t be
ridiculous.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m here, and I never was more
comfortable in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, calling down the grating &ldquo;Oh!&nbsp;
Is it you, Aunt Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Of course it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;You recognize my voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;I should hope so, indeed!&nbsp;
Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

we&rsquo;ll soon have you out.&nbsp; Think of baby, and
don&rsquo;t give way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;I shall not, if the elevator
doesn&rsquo;t, you may depend upon that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh, what courage you <i>do</i>
have!&nbsp; But keep up your spirits!&nbsp; Mrs. Miller and I
have just come from seeing baby.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s gone to sleep
with all her little presents in her arms.&nbsp; The children did
want to see you so much before they went to bed.&nbsp; But never
mind that now, Aunt Mary.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only too thankful to
have you at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;I wish you did have me!&nbsp; And
if you will all stop talking and try some of you to do something,
I shall be greatly obliged to you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s worse than it
was in the sleeping car that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh, do you remember it, Aunt
Mary?&nbsp; Oh, how funny you are!&rdquo;&nbsp; Turning
heroically to her husband: &ldquo;Now, Edward, dear, <a

out.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s necessary, get them out over my dead
body.&nbsp; Anything!&nbsp; Only hurry.&nbsp; I will be calm; I
will be patient.&nbsp; But you must act instantly.&nbsp; Oh, here
comes Mr. Curwen!&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Mr. Curwen</i> mounts the
stairs to the landing with every sign of exhaustion, as if he had
made a very quick run to and from his house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,

the elevator is caught just below here with my aunt in it and
Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s husband&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;And my girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;And my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>, calling up: &ldquo;And your
wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>, horror-struck: &ldquo;And my wife!&nbsp; Oh,
heavenly powers! what are we going to do?&nbsp; How shall we get
them out?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t they come up?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>All</i>: &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Oh, my
goodness!&rdquo;&nbsp; He flies at the grating, and kicks and
beats it.</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Hold on!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t get at them if you
beat the door down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;&nbsp; They lay
hands upon him and restrain him.</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span><i>Curwen</i>, struggling: &ldquo;Let me speak to my
wife!&nbsp; Will you prevent a husband from speaking to his own
wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>, in blind admiration of his frenzy:
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s just what I said.&nbsp; If some one had
beaten the door in at once&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh, Edward, dear, let him speak to
his wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tearfully: &ldquo;Think if <i>I</i> were
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>, releasing him: &ldquo;He may speak to his wife
all night.&nbsp; But he mustn&rsquo;t knock the house
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>, rushing at the grating: &ldquo;Caroline!&nbsp;
Can you hear me?&nbsp; Are you safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Perfectly.&nbsp; I had a little
faint when we first stuck&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Faint?&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;But I am all right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be frightened!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no occasion for
excitement.&nbsp; Keep perfectly calm and collected.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the only way&mdash;What&rsquo;s that
ringing?&rdquo;&nbsp; The sound of an electric bell is heard
within the elevator.&nbsp; It increases in fury.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i> and <i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;Oh,
isn&rsquo;t it dreadful?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got your

<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Left, you mean, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Yes, left, dearest!&nbsp; I <i>mean</i>
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Eight-button?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Light drab?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>, pulling a light yellow glove from his pocket:
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&nbsp; He staggers away from the grating and
stays himself against the wall, the mistaken glove dangling
limply from his hand.</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>, <i>Lawton</i>, and <i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Ah!
ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh, for shame! to laugh at such a

<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s a question of life
and death.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; The ringing&rsquo;s stopped.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;&nbsp; Steps are heard mounting the
stairway rapidly, several treads at a time.&nbsp; Mr. Campbell <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>suddenly
bursts into the group on the landing with a final bound from the
stairway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find Aunt Mary,
Agnes.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t find anything&mdash;not even the
elevator.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the elevator?&nbsp; I rang for it
down there till I was black in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;No wonder!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;Between this floor and the floor
below.&nbsp; With my husband in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>: &ldquo;And my wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;And my daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bemis</i>: &ldquo;And my son!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;And aunty!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>All</i>: &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s stuck fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>: &ldquo;And the long and short of it is,
Willis, that we don&rsquo;t know how to get them out, and we wish
you would suggest some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a great tacit
confidence among us in your executive ability and your inventive
genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Oh, yes, we know you can do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t, nothing can

<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Start her up!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Now, look here, Campbell, we are not
going to stand that; we&rsquo;ve had enough of it.&nbsp; I speak
for the whole elevator.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you suppose that if it

<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t have been at the

<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Well, then, start her

<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;I never thought of that.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
the <i>Elevator Boy</i>: &ldquo;Start her down.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
the people on the landing above: &ldquo;Hurrah!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
off!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Well, <i>now</i> start her
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A joint cry from the elevator: &ldquo;Thank you! we&rsquo;ll
walk up this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Here! let us out at this
landing!&rdquo;&nbsp; They are heard precipitately emerging, with
sighs and groans of relief, on the floor below.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, devoutly: &ldquo;O Willis, it seems like
an interposition of Providence, your coming just at this
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Interposition of common sense!&nbsp;
These hydraulic elevators weaken sometimes, and can&rsquo;t go
any farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Roberts</i>, to the shipwrecked guests, who arrive <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>at the top
of the stairs, crestfallen, spent, and clinging to one another
for support: &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you think of starting her
down, some of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, welcoming them with kisses and
hand-shakes: &ldquo;I should have thought it would occur to you
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>, goaded to exasperation: &ldquo;Did it occur to
any of <i>you</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lawton</i>, with sublime impudence: &ldquo;It occurred to
<i>all</i> of us.&nbsp; But we naturally supposed you had tried
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>, taking possession of her husband:
&ldquo;Oh, what a fright you have given us!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;<i>I</i> given you!&nbsp; Do you suppose
I did it out of a joke, or voluntarily?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Aunty, I don&rsquo;t know what to
say to you.&nbsp; <i>You</i> ought to have been here long ago,
before anything happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Crashaw</i>: &ldquo;Oh, I can explain everything in
due season.&nbsp; What I wish you to do now is to let me get at
Willis, and kiss him.&rdquo;&nbsp; As <i>Campbell</i> submits to
her embrace: &ldquo;You dear, good fellow!&nbsp; If it
hadn&rsquo;t been for your presence of mind, I don&rsquo;t know
how we should ever have got out of that horrid pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>, giving him her hand: &ldquo;As it
isn&rsquo;t proper for <i>me</i> to kiss you&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Campbell</i>: &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t wish to be <i>too</i> modest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;I think I shall have to vote you a
service of plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>: &ldquo;Come and look at the pattern of
mine.&nbsp; And, Willis, as you are the true hero of the
occasion, you shall take me in to dinner.&nbsp; And I am not
going to let anybody go before you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She seizes his
arm, and leads the way from the landing into the apartment.&nbsp;
<i>Roberts</i>, <i>Lawton</i>, and <i>Bemis</i> follow
stragglingly.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>, getting her husband to one side:
&ldquo;When she fainted, she fainted <i>at</i> you, of
course!&nbsp; What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miller</i>: &ldquo;Who?&nbsp; I!&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo;&nbsp;
After a moment&rsquo;s reflection: &ldquo;She came to!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Curwen</i>, getting his wife aside: &ldquo;When you
fainted, Caroline, who revived you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Who?&nbsp; <i>Me</i>?&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; How should I know?&nbsp; I was insensible.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They wheel arm in arm, and meet <i>Mr.</i> and <i>Mrs. Miller</i>
in the middle.&nbsp; <i>Mrs. Curwen</i> yields precedence with an
ironical courtesy: &ldquo;After you, Mrs. Miller!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span><i>Mrs. Miller</i>, in a nervous, inimical twitter:
&ldquo;Oh, before the heroine of the lost elevator?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>, dropping her husband&rsquo;s arm, and
taking <i>Mrs. Miller&rsquo;s</i>: &ldquo;Let us split the
difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;Delightful!&nbsp; I shall never
forget the honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Curwen</i>: &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak of
honors!&nbsp; Mr. Miller was <i>so</i> kind through all those
terrible scenes in the elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Miller</i>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt you showed
yourself duly grateful.&rdquo;&nbsp; They pass in, followed by
their husbands.</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>, timidly: &ldquo;Miss Lawton, in the
elevator you asked me not to leave you.&nbsp; Did
you&mdash;ah&mdash;mean&mdash;I <i>must</i> ask you; it may be my
only chance; if you meant&mdash;never?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>, dropping her head:
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;But if I <i>wished</i> never to
leave you, should you send me away?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Miss Lawton</i>, with a shy, sly upward glance at him:
&ldquo;Not in the elevator!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Young Mr. Bemis</i>: &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Roberts</i>, re-appearing at the door: &ldquo;Why, <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>you
good-for-nothing young things, why don&rsquo;t you come
to&mdash;Oh! excuse me!&rdquo;&nbsp; She re-enters precipitately,
followed by her tardy guests, on whom she casts a backward glance
of sympathy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you <i>needn&rsquo;t</i>
hurry!&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
